# Threat Detection Using AlexNet

# Goals
This project aims to help assess threats before any harm can take place. It uses AI to capture images and video to identify weapons that can cause harm to the public. One of our biggest problems today is gun safety and threats to the public.A bigger issue is police wrongly identifying subjects as a threat and causing harm when it is not necessary. These past years we have seen countless acts of police brutality on people who were not a threat to their safety. 
# Application
The use of this program is to identify threats before harm can be done in places where people are more vulnerable. And to give police a second perspective to identify a person as a threat or not. People should not have to live in fear and be looking for a threat every second of their day. Police have a very stressful job which might hinder their identification so this can help them have more confidence going into dangerous situations.
# Implementation
To implement this idea in everyday living, we could upload this program to all cameras throughout cities, public buildings, schools, restaurants, and any other place that may need a extra set of eyes. For police, this will be through their body cameras which sees everything they do on the job, giving them alerts if it sees a potential threat. This program will identify body language, facial expressions, and potential weapons that can harm people.
# AlexNet
AlexNet is a convolutional neural network that is 8 layers deep.
A pre trained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. The pre trained network can classify images into 1000 object categories using filters to observe different distinctions between objects. These filters take individual pixels and calculate different values around that pixel to show different characteristics. These characteristics help show the difference between objects. These characteristics can also distinguish between facial expressions and body language. 
# Result
AI is still developing and will never be perfect, however, I believe this program can save lives and give people more safety and confidence to love their everyday lives. This will not be used as the only way to tell if someone is a threat or not, only an aid to help people be more aware.
